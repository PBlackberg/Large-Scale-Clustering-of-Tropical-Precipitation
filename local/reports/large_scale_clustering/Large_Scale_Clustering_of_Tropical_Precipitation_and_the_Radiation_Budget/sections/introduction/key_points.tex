\item 
Climate models project future increases in large-scale clustering of tropical precipitation and a meridional contraction of heavy rainfall

\item
Changes in clustering are sensitive to the Pacific SST gradient in observed and simulated interannual variability and in model projections

\item
Effect of changes in clustering on the radiation budget depends on timescale, precluding an observational constraint on climate sensitivity
