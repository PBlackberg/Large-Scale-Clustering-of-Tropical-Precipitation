\acknowledgments
We acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme’s Working Group on Coupled Modelling, which is responsible for CMIP, 
and we thank the climate modeling groups (listed in Table S1 in the supporting information) for producing and making available their model output. 
Further, we acknowledge the Deutsches Klimarechenzentrum (DKRZ) for providing resources for using the Levante supercomputer, which facilitated the analysis of the nextGEMS Cycle 2 simulation: IFS\_9\_FESOM\_5 used in this study. 
We also extend a special thank you to Dr. Cathy Hohenegger at Max Planck Insntitute for Meteorology for hosting the first author during a research visit to Hamburg, 
for providing guidance on model selection, and for facilitating access to institutional resources that greatly supported the analysis of the high-resolution GCM used in this study. 
Finally, we acknowledge support from the Australian Research Council (ARC) (grant no. DP230102077), 
the ARC Centre of Excellence for the Weather of the 21st Century (grant no. CE170100023), 
and computational resources and services from the National Computational Infrastructure, 
all funded by the Australian Government.
