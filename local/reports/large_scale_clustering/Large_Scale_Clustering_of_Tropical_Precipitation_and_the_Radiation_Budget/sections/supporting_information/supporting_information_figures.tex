    The ij'th box show the correlation between metric in row i and column j for interannual variability in the CMIP ensemble. In each box, the top value shows ensemble-mean, the value below show standard deviation of correlations, and the fraction at the bottom shows what fraction of models have statistically significant correlations. Details of the metrics are given in Table S2.
